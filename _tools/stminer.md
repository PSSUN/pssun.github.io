  STMiner is a Python package for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. It leverages 2D Gaussian mixture models and optimal transport theory to directly characterize the spatial distribution of genes, effectively mitigating the impacts of background bias and data sparsity. STMiner reveals key gene sets and spatial structures overlooked by spot-based analytic tools, facilitating novel biological discoveries in tumor tissues and complex spatial data.
