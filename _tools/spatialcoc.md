description: >-
  SpatialCOC is a deep learning framework that deciphers cellular spatial organization and cross-omics relationships in spatial multi-omics data. It treats different omics modalities as continuous functions defined by their shared spatial coordinates, enabling it to uncover nonlinear correlations among these modalities. SpatialCOC excels in identifying region-specific continuous spatial domains and maintains batch-consistency across trajectory inferences.
